#!/usr/bin/env bash
# install-opencode.sh — install the opencode_skill skills into OpenCode.
#
# OpenCode discovers skills from ~/.config/opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md
# (global) or .opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md (per-project). OpenCode has no
# {baseDir} placeholder, so we substitute it with the real install path in the
# copied SKILL.md, leaving the source tree untouched.
#
# Every install snapshots the live directory first, so a bad version can be
# undone with --rollback without needing the git history.
#
# Usage:
#   ./install-opencode.sh                 # install all skills globally
#   ./install-opencode.sh --project DIR   # install into DIR/.opencode/skills
#   ./install-opencode.sh sqltune slowsql # install only the named skills
#   ./install-opencode.sh --dry-run       # show what would happen
#   ./install-opencode.sh --versions      # show what is installed + snapshots
#   ./install-opencode.sh --rollback      # restore the newest snapshot
#   ./install-opencode.sh --rollback DIR  # restore a specific snapshot
